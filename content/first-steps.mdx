# First Steps

The beginning of something new. Here's what I'm working on and why it matters.

## Starting Fresh

Every journey begins with a single step. This digital garden represents a new chapter—a space to think, create, and grow.

## Current Focus

Right now, I'm focused on:
- Building this digital garden
- Establishing daily habits
- Learning and documenting the process

## The Plan

This space will evolve over time. I'm starting simple and will add features as needed. The goal is progress, not perfection.

Here's to the first steps.
