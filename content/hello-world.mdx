# Hello World

Welcome to my digital garden. This is where I'll share thoughts, ideas, and learnings.

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a space for cultivating ideas over time. Unlike traditional blogs with chronological posts, a digital garden allows ideas to grow, evolve, and interconnect.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Thoughts**: Reflections on life, work, and everything in between
- **Projects**: Things I'm building and learning
- **Notes**: Quick captures of interesting ideas
- **Habits**: Tracking progress on the things that matter

## Getting Started

This is just the beginning. As I continue to build and learn, this space will grow and evolve. Thanks for joining me on this journey.
