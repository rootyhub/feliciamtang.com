# Building in Public

Why I'm documenting my journey and what I hope to learn along the way.

## Why Build in Public?

Building in public means sharing your process, not just your results. It's about transparency, learning, and community.

## The Benefits

1. **Accountability**: Sharing progress keeps me motivated
2. **Learning**: Feedback helps me improve
3. **Connection**: Building in public creates opportunities to connect with others
4. **Documentation**: A record of the journey, not just the destination

## What to Expect

I'll be sharing:
- Wins and failures
- Technical learnings
- Process and methodology
- Behind-the-scenes insights

Let's build together.
